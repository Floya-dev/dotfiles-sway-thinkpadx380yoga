# ‚ú® SwayWM Dotfiles

Dotfiles for the sway window manager on my Thinkpad X380 Yoga.

Feel free to modify, take inspiration or use my dotfiles! I use these configs on a daily basis, in school, at home, for literally anything, except for gaming. It's a mostly productive and comfort based setup.<br>

I took me while to get this together, and I want to keep on improving my dotfiles. If you find any issues please address them in the GitHub Issues tab. I'm always looking forward on improving.<br>

All applications I use are listed here. Most of them is based on experience or recommendation.<br>
